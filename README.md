# Wom Quest
Wom Quest is a gamified, peer-to-peer platform that rewards and incentivizes users to share referral codes and save a lot of money. The main idea behind this crowdsourced deal platform, is that current B2C coupon and discount platforms are broken due to coupon fraud, infringement, or even lack of coupon validation. Wom Quest aims to change that by providing a P2P platform that is fun and rewarding.
